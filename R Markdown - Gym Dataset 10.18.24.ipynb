In addition, it tells us that majority of gym members have little to no idea on what to do or what their goals may be. This is important because analyzing `Median Age Based on Experience and Sex` suggests that men and women who are `Beginners` or `Intermediate` spend less time at the gym. To add on, the graph `Calories Burned by Time Spent at the Gym` suggests that there is a positive correlation between the amount of calories burned and time spend at the gym. This means that the amount of calories burn increase as session duration at the gym increases as well.\n",

The reason being is that most `Beginners` appear to higher amount of interest in `Cardio`, while `Intermediate` members prefer more `Strength` training. This tells gym owners what members will generally gravitate towards in terms of what to do at the gym. This will offer insight on how gym owners will advertise their workout programs to gym members, and could ultimately increase session duration for `Beginner` and `Intermediate` members.\n",
